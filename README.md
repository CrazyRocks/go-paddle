# go-paddle
This is a Go library for [Paddle](https://paddle.com).

It's far from perfect and there are no examples and no documentation, but it can save you some time.
I'm sure you'll understand that I prefer to work on my products than on this library, given that it's good enough for me as it is.

Please see [Paddle Woes with Solutions](https://jasminek.net/blog/post/paddle-problems/) for some background.
